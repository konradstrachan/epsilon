# Epsilon: Trustless AI-Powered Social blockchain interactions

Epsilon is the name of the project being built as part of 100.builders that builds upon an initial concept developed during the ETH Global SuperHack Hackathon. The project aims to introduce a new way for users send funds (and interact with blockchains in general) on existing social networks, leveraging the power of AI language processing and smart contract wallets. By eliminating the need for trust assumptions, Epsilon introduces a new level of security and transparency to social network-based financial transactions.

## Introduction
Epsilon was born out of the ETH Global SuperHack Hackathon, where the initial idea of creating a trustless Telegram bot using existing smart contract wallets was explored. Building upon this foundation, Epsilon takes a stp forward by integrating AI language processing capabilities to enable seamless fund transfers between users of various social networks. This project aims to bridge the gap between traditional social interactions and blockchain-powered financial transactions.

## Key Features
* Trustless Transactions: Epsilon eliminates the need for trust between users by utilizing smart contract wallets for fund transfers, ensuring security and transparency.
* AI Language Processing: The integration of AI language processing enables natural communication for initiating transactions, making the process intuitive and user-friendly.
* Cross-Social Network: Epsilon is designed to work across different social networks, allowing users from various platforms to send funds without constraints.
* Privacy Emphasis: The project places a strong emphasis on user privacy, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure throughout the transaction process.

## How It Works
Epsilon operates as an AI-powered intermediary for fund transfers between users. 

Leveraging the AI language processing engine, users can communicate their intent to initiate a transaction in a natural and conversational manner. 

Epsilon interprets the messages, validates the intent, and interacts with the respective smart contract wallet to execute the transaction securely on the blockchain. 

This approach enables a seamless user experience and broadens the adoption of blockchain technology in everyday financial interactions.

## Technologies Used
Smart contract wallets (e.g., Safe by Gnosis)
AI language processing (initially targetting OpenAI models via API access)
Python for backend logic
Telegram Bot API (for Telegram integration)
